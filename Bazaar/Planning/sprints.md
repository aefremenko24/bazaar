**SUBJECT**: Sprint Planning (1-3)

Before beginning the work on The Bazaar Game project, we would like to arrange the milestones that include the components of the system to be done in the first three sprints. These milestones are shown in this memo below.

## Sprint 1 
- Define the basic data structures for game components such as Players, Pebbles, Cards, Bank, Equations, etc(approx. 8 hours). 
- Create the first version of GUI for the game (not yet connected to the model). Use pseudo-Referee and pseudo-GameState to display the gameplay. Create the first draft for the (GUIs of) pebble, board, player, cards, and equation icons(approx. 8 hours).

## Sprint 2
- Using the data structures created in Sprint 1, create the first version of the rules enforced in the game. Write out in pseudocode how the model, view, and controller will interact with each other and abide by the rules of The Bazaar Game listed in the rulebook(approx. 12 hours).
- Create an initializer for the starting state of the game, with all players and the bank initialized according to the rulebook(approx. 4 hours).

## Sprint 3
- Fully test the results from Sprint 1 and Sprint 2. Write unit tests, for the main parts of the program. Clean up and ensure clarity in the communication between the model, view, and controller before the online connection is added. (approx. 8 hours). 
- Fix any bugs that occurred from unit tests. In case we have time left before we wrap up Sprint 3, use the time to enhance existing features such as user experience, GUI design, and think about edge cases in referee rules(approx. 8 hours).

Thank you again for your time. It is a pleasure working with you.

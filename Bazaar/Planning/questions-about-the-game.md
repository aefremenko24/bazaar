**SUBJECT**: Questions about the game


When going over The Bazaar Game rulebook, a couple questions have come up that we would like to address before proceeding with the project.

1. When the referee puts four cards on the playing field, are the cards chosen at random?

2. Should we enforce rules programmatically in the Game GUI or should the referee catch the players making illegal moves? (e.g. some games would allow the player to make an illegal move and call it out later, versus other games where if an illegal move is chosen by the player, the proceed button would not be clickable.)

3. What happens if some players team up against one player and donâ€™t allow trade, does that abide by the rules? 

Thank you for your time. We are looking forward to hearing back from you.

# Directory _Player_

## Purpose
This directory contains files and data models that will be available of the player of the Bazaar game to use.

## Files and Directories:

- **\_\_init\_\_.py**: marks this directory on disk as a Python package directory.
- **exchanges.py**: data representation for representing pebble exchanges.
- **test_strategy.py**: tests for strategy.py
- **purchases.py**: data representation for representing the purchases of cards.
- **test_purchases.py**: tests for purchases.py
- **strategy.py**: data representation of the player's strategy in the Bazaar game.
- **mechanism.py**: data representation of the player's mechanism in the Bazaar game.
- **test_mechanism.py**: tests for mechanism.py
- **decorators.py**: definitions for decorators used to alter the behavior of the mechanism

To run the tests, run the files beginning with "test" with Python. E.g. ``python3 ./Referee/test_game_state.py``.

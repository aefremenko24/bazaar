## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 10

The ideal answer for each of the following questions consists of two or three sentences.


1. What role do purpose statements play?

Purpose statements provide the reader with the context for what the piece of code they are looking at is meant to do. They are also a source of crucial interpretation of the code, which might not be as easy to infer from the code itself. 

2. How do unit tests help with software development?

Code without unit tests means that there are bugs just waiting to be found. Unit tests help minimize bugs in logic and make sure functions/pieces of code work as intended at all.

3. Which milestone was the most difficult to unit-test?

Milestone 4 was the hardest to unit test. The testing for tie breaking logic and algorithms got messy, especially because our functions were long and were not properly abstracted. 

4. Did you struggle with your TAHBPL or was the language helpful?

I think it was helpful that Python had a wide range of libraries to choose from; however, the lack of type checking and no error checking at compile time made it more difficult to debug and catch errors.

5. What would you differently if you could send a message to your younger self in early September 2024? 

Learn how to manage time better. This class is very hard to combine with other difficult classes and gets really overwhelming if not managed properly.

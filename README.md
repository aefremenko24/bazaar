# bazaar

Python implementation of The Bazaar Game - a strategic trading and scoring game for 2 to 6 players. Players trade colored pebbles using predefined equations to acquire cards, scoring points based on pebbles left and card types. The repository features a digital referee, random pebble draws, score tracking, and rule enforcement. Ideal for exploring game logic and trade optimization. 

In this implementation, the players and the server are connected over TCP, with the virtual referee running the game. House AI players are implemented to fill up servers with a few human players.
